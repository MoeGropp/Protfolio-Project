    <p>    
    The Lykoi was discovered by two different sets of domestic shorthairs with the Lykoi gene were adopted from a rescue after being discovered in Virginia in 2010, by Patti Thomas, who co-founded and named the breed, and in 2011, a second pair were located in Tennessee, by Johnny Gobble. 
    Black roan Lykoi cats are the standard color, with a slightly silvery appearance. The Lykoi has no undercoat, leaving him with just the thin top hairs, which can make them look almost mangyâ€”like a werewolf. 
    Their eyes are nearly round and amber or green in color.
    This breed is still considered an experimental breed, as the first official identification happened fairly recently in 2012. 
<br/><div class="facts">
Here are a few facts about them:
</div>
    <ul>
        <div class="list">
    <li>
    The name Lykoi, is from the Greek word Lykos meaning 'wolf'.
    </li> 
    <li>
    They get their unique features from a naturally occuring genetic mutaion.
    </li>
    <li>
    All of the current domestic Lykoi in the world can trace their lineage back to feral cats.  
    </li>
    <li>
    They are not genetically connected to the Sphynx cat.   
    </li>
    <li>
    They can shed their <em><strong>entire</em></strong> coat a couple times a year; so they are not considered hypoallergenic.
    </li>
